# NCP - AoA Locator

This is an NCP (Network Co-Processor) target example to be used together with the **aoa_locator** NCP host example. The **NCP - AoA Locator** NCP target and the **aoa_locator** NCP host examples together demonstrate a locator that can receive CTEs  (Constant Tone Extensions) from asset tags and estimate their directions (AoA - Angle of Arrival).

Use this example together with **SoC - AoA Asset Tag**, which can transmit CTE signals.

> Note: this example expects a specific Gecko Bootloader to be present on your device. For details see the Troubleshooting section.

## Getting Started

To get started with Silicon Labs Bluetooth software and Simplicity Studio, see [QSG169: Bluetooth SDK v3.x Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg169-bluetooth-sdk-v3x-quick-start-guide.pdf).

To learn how an NCP (Network Co-Processor) setup works, see [AN1259: Using the v3.x Silicon Labs Bluetooth Stack in Network Co-Processor Mode](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1259-bt-ncp-mode-sdk-v3x.pdf). You should also test the **NCP - Empty** example first.

To learn the basics of Bluetooth direction finding technology, see [UG103.18: Bluetooth Direction Finding Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-18-bluetooth-direction-finding-fundamentals.pdf).

To get started with Silicon Labs' Direction Finding Solution, see [QSG175: Silicon Labs Direction Finding Solution Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg175-direction-finding-solution-quick-start-guide.pdf).

In an AoA direction finding use case, the tag acts as a transmitter and the locator acts as a receiver. The locator determines the direction of the tag by sampling the signal of the tag on different antennas of an antenna array and measuring phase differences.

To estimate the direction of the incoming signal, the AoA Locator needs to receive a special Bluetooth packet, which has a Constant Tone Extension (CTE). CTEs can be transmitted in the following ways:

* Via a Bluetooth connections (connection oriented mode)
* In periodic advertisements (connectionless mode)
* Attached to extended advertisements, which is not part of the Bluetooth standard, but is a Silicon Labs proprietary solution (Silicon Labs mode).

This example provides support for the following:

* Requesting and receiving CTEs on connections
* Receiving CTEs from periodic advertisements and Silicon Labs proprietary extended advertisements
* Taking IQ samples on the received CTEs.

This way, the NCP host example can locate the asset tag by estimating the Angle of Arrival from the received IQ samples.

**NCP - AoA Locator** target can be run on antenna array boards only. **aoa_locator** host is typically run on PC or Raspberry Pi.

The whole setup looks like this:

## Testing the NCP - AoA Locator Application

After programming your antenna array board with the **NCP - AoA Locator** target example, program another board with an **SoC - AoA Asset Tag** example, and then start the **AoA Analyzer** tool as described in [QSG175: Silicon Labs Direction Finding Solution Quick-Start Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/quick-start-guides/qsg175-direction-finding-solution-quick-start-guide.pdf).

## Troubleshooting

Note that, when using **NCP - AoA Locator**, you may need to change the mainboard flow control settings. Follow the instructions of [AN1296: Application Development with Silicon Labs’ RTL Library](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1296-application-development-with-rtl-library.pdf).

### Bootloader Issues

Note that Example Projects do not include a bootloader. However, Bluetooth-based Example Projects expect a bootloader to be present on the device in order to support device firmware upgrade (DFU). To get your application to work, you should either 
- flash the proper bootloader or
- remove the DFU functionality from the project.

**If you do not wish to add a bootloader**, then remove the DFU functionality by uninstalling the *Bootloader Application Interface* software component -- and all of its dependants. This will automatically put your application code to the start address of the flash, which means that a bootloader is no longer needed, but also that you will not be able to upgrade your firmware.

**If you want to add a bootloader**, then either 
- Create a bootloader project, build it and flash it to your device. Note that different projects expect different bootloaders:
  - for NCP and RCP projects create a *BGAPI UART DFU* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 1 devices create a *Bluetooth in-place OTA DFU* type bootloader or any *Internal Storage* type bootloader
  - for SoC projects on Series 2 devices create a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader

- or run a precompiled Demo on your device from the Launcher view before flashing your application. Precompiled demos flash both bootloader and application images to the device. Flashing your own application image after the demo will overwrite the demo application but leave the bootloader in place. 
  - For NCP and RCP projects, flash the *Bluetooth - NCP* demo.
  - For SoC projects, flash the *Bluetooth - SoC Thermometer* demo.

**Important Notes:** 
- when you flash your application image to the device, use the *.hex* or *.s37* output file. Flashing *.bin* files may overwrite (erase) the bootloader.

- On Series 1 devices (EFR32xG1x), both first stage and second stage bootloaders have to be flashed. This can be done at once by flashing the *-combined.s37* file found in the bootloader project after building the project.

- On Series 2 devices SoC example projects require a *Bluetooth Apploader OTA DFU* type bootloader by default. This bootloader needs a lot of flash space and does not fit into the regular bootloader area, hence the application start address must be shifted. This shift is automatically done by the *Apploader Support for Applications* software component, which is installed by default. If you want to use any other bootloader type, you should remove this software component in order to shift the application start address back to the end of the regular bootloader area. Note, that in this case you cannot do OTA DFU with Apploader, but you can still implement application-level OTA DFU by installing the *Application OTA DFU* software component instead of *In-place OTA DFU*.

For more information on bootloaders, see [UG103.6: Bootloader Fundamentals](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-06-fundamentals-bootloading.pdf) and [UG489: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader User's Guide for GSDK 4.0 and Higher](https://cn.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug489-gecko-bootloader-user-guide-gsdk-4.pdf).


### Programming the Radio Board

Before programming the radio board mounted on the mainboard, make sure the power supply switch is in the AEM position (right side) as shown below.
