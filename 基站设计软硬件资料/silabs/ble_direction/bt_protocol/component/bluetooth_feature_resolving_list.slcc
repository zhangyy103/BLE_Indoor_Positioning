package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  Provides support for the Resolving List in controller-based privacy. Adding a
  peer device to the Resolving List allows the Bluetooth controller to resolve
  the address when the peer device is using privacy and is transmitting with a
  Resolvable Private Address (RPA). It also allows the application to use the
  peer device's identity address when connecting or scanning for periodic
  synchronization.
