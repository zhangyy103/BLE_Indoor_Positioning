description: >
  Synchronize to periodic advertising trains by scanning for extended
  advertisements that provide the synchronization information.

  The <bluetooth_feature_periodic_sync> component is automatically included to
  provide support for periodic advertising trains that do not have subevents or
  response slots. The application must explicitly include the
  <bluetooth_feature_pawr_sync> component if it needs support for Periodic
  Advertising with Responses (PAwR) trains.
